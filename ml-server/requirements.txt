\noindent
\textbf{\fontsize{16}{12}\selectfont 2.1 Survey of Existing Systems}

\justifying
\noindent The field of stock market prediction and portfolio management has witnessed significant development over the past decade, with approaches evolving from traditional statistical techniques to advanced deep learning frameworks. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of existing systems and their methodologies, drawing on both academic research and commercial implementations.\\[0.3cm]

\noindent\textbf{2.1.1 Traditional Statistical and Early Machine Learning Approaches}\\
\noindent Early stock market prediction systems primarily relied on classical statistical models and basic machine learning algorithms. Mokhtari et al. (2021) [2] conducted a comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence effectiveness in stock market prediction, covering both technical and fundamental analysis methods. Their findings showed that traditional models such as ARIMA and linear regression often struggled to capture the complex, non-linear behavior of financial markets[4].

\noindent Although linear regression models achieved high coefficients of determination (R² values up to 1.0) for historical technical data, they frequently suffered from overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data. Among early machine learning methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM) performed relatively better, achieving approximately 76\% classification accuracy in sentiment-based analysis [2]. However, this level of performance was still insufficient for consistent and profitable trading outcomes.\\

\noindent\textbf{2.1.2 Advanced Deep Learning Approaches}\\
\noindent With the advent of deep learning, stock market prediction systems have achieved notable improvements in performance and interpretability. Seo and Yang (2022) [1] proposed the \textbf{Multi-Time Context Vector and Randomness (MTC-R)} model, which marked a significant advancement in handling temporal complexity within stock prediction tasks. The MTC-R framework introduced several key innovations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Time Embedding:} Combining Time2Vec encoding with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks enables the model to capture multiple temporal contexts simultaneously, improving prediction accuracy by 0.5–1.0\%.
    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanisms with Randomness:} Incorporating multi-head attention with learnable Gaussian noise models trader uncertainty more effectively, improving the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) by 0.02–0.06.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Difference Learning:} Inspired by reinforcement learning, the TD(0) mechanism relates current market states to future price actions, producing confidence-based predictions with reduced variance.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These innovations demonstrate that deep learning-based temporal modeling and uncertainty handling significantly outperform traditional statistical approaches [3].\\

\noindent\textbf{2.1.3 Hybrid Analysis Approaches}\\
\noindent The combination of technical and fundamental analysis has become a promising research direction for financial forecasting. Mokhtari et al. (2021) [2] explored hybrid models that integrate both aspects and evaluated their performance using historical Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data spanning ten years. Their results indicated that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear regression models achieved near-perfect fitting on historical data (\(R^2 = 1.0\), RMSE = 1.82)
    \item LSTM models showed more realistic generalization with \(R^2 = 0.99\), RMSE = 3.42 {3}
    \item Twitter sentiment analysis using SVM achieved 76\% classification accuracy
\end{itemize}

\noindent Despite these advances, the study concluded that existing AI systems remain insufficiently robust to consistently outperform the stock market, emphasizing the need for integrated and adaptive approaches combining multiple data sources.\\

\noindent\textbf{2.1.4 Current Commercial and Academic Platforms}\\
\noindent Current commercial and academic platforms, though sophisticated, continue to exhibit several limitations as highlighted in recent research.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fragmented Solutions:} Most existing systems provide either predictive analytics (e.g., TradingView, QuantConnect) or portfolio management (e.g., Portfolio123) but rarely both in a unified platform.
    \item \textbf{Limited Temporal Context:} Traditional platforms rely on fixed-time analysis windows, missing out on variable temporal dependencies.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Confidence Metrics:} Many systems still offer binary “buy/sell” predictions without confidence levels, reducing transparency and trust.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These limitations underscore the need for a cohesive platform like \textbf{IntelliStock}, which integrates predictive intelligence with portfolio management and confidence-driven decision support.\\

\noindent\textbf{2.1.5 Emerging Trends in Financial AI}\\
\noindent Recent advancements and research trends indicate key directions shaping the future of financial prediction systems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Temporal Analysis:} Building on MTC-R’s success {1}, new models focus on analyzing diverse timeframes to better represent market dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Interpretable AI:} As financial AI grows more regulated, explainability is becoming critical to ensure transparency and compliance.
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Processing:} The demand for low-latency, high-frequency trading requires models capable of microsecond-level computation without compromising accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These developments collectively highlight the direction toward integrated, real-time, and explainable AI-driven financial systems—principles that form the foundation of \textbf{IntelliStock}.\\

\noindent \textbf{\fontsize{16}{12}\selectfont 2.2 Limitations of Existing Systems or Research Gaps}

\justifying
\noindent Based on an extensive analysis of existing literature and commercial systems in the field of stock prediction and portfolio management, several critical limitations have been identified [1,2]. Despite remarkable progress in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and financial data analytics, existing systems still face challenges related to temporal adaptability, interpretability, integration, and robustness. These issues highlight the need for more comprehensive and intelligent AI-driven financial architectures capable of handling real-world complexities [3].\\

\noindent \textbf{2.2.1 Temporal Context Limitations}\\
\noindent Most models fail to capture the multi-scale nature of financial time series data effectively [4]. Both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends influence market patterns, yet many systems rely on a single fixed time window for analysis. This significantly limits predictive accuracy and adaptability across varying time horizons. The key challenges include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Time Window Dependency:} Existing models focus on short-term data, ignoring long-term dependencies that affect stock volatility and price movement.
    \item \textbf{Inadequate Randomness Modeling:} Systems often fail to account for “noise traders” or random market behaviors, reducing resilience during unpredictable events.
    \item \textbf{Static Feature Engineering:} Traditional indicators such as moving averages or RSI are applied uniformly, without adapting to market regime or volatility shifts.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Multi-Temporal Learning:} Few models leverage time-aware embeddings or hierarchical learning to represent dependencies across multiple time frames simultaneously.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{2.2.2 Integration and Usability Gaps}\\
\noindent There remains a significant disconnect between predictive analytics tools and portfolio management systems . Traders and investors are often forced to rely on multiple platforms for analysis, execution, and evaluation, leading to inefficiencies and fragmented workflows.\\
\noindent The major usability challenges include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Disconnected Analysis and Management:} Users often switch between forecasting models and separate portfolio trackers, increasing the chance of human error and data inconsistency.
    \item \textbf{Limited Confidence Assessment:} Current models rarely provide uncertainty or confidence intervals, leaving users unaware of prediction reliability.
    \item \textbf{Poor User Experience:} Existing platforms are either overly technical or designed for institutional investors, offering minimal support for retail users.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Real-Time Insights:} Delayed data processing and lack of live updates prevent timely decision-making during rapid market movements.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{2.2.3 Methodological Limitations}\\
\noindent Many academic and commercial models employ inconsistent methodologies and fail to maintain generalizability across datasets . Additionally, scalability remains a serious concern as models trained on limited datasets often collapse under real-world financial data volumes[3].\\
\noindent The main methodological limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insufficient Validation Frameworks:} Inconsistent data-splitting strategies often cause overfitting and inflated performance claims.
    \item \textbf{Limited Multi-Asset Support:} Most systems focus solely on single stock predictions and do not account for portfolio correlation or asset diversification.
    \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints:} Many prototypes show good accuracy in controlled conditions but fail to perform efficiently when handling live or large-scale financial data streams.
    \item \textbf{Inconsistent Benchmarking:} Lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics prevents fair comparison between different research works.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{2.2.4 Market Regime Adaptation}\\
\noindent The financial market is dynamic, with changing regimes such as bullish, bearish, and volatile conditions. Most models, however, remain static and fail to adapt to regime shifts or extreme market events, resulting in unreliable predictions during high-risk periods.[4]\\[0.1cm]
\noindent The primary adaptation issues include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Static Model Architecture:} Models are trained on historical data without mechanisms for continual learning or real-time fine-tuning.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Regime Detection:} Few systems incorporate mechanisms to automatically detect and adjust to market condition changes.
    \item \textbf{Inadequate Stress Testing:} Existing studies rarely assess model resilience under extreme volatility, crashes, or black-swan events.
    \item \textbf{Delayed Recovery Learning:} Systems often fail to quickly recalibrate following sudden changes in market trends or investor sentiment.

\section{Introduction}

Access to legal assistance is a cornerstone of justice and equality in any democratic society. However, despite being a fundamental right, obtaining proper legal help remains a significant challenge for many individuals, particularly in the field of family law. Matters such as divorce, child custody, domestic disputes, and adoption involve not only legal complexities but also emotional stress, making it difficult for people to navigate the legal system without guidance. The procedures are often laden with intricate legal terminology, lengthy documentation, and procedural formalities that are hard to comprehend for a layperson. Furthermore, the high cost of hiring professional legal counsel and the limited availability of affordable legal aid services add to the difficulty faced by citizens, often discouraging them from seeking justice altogether.

In today's digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated immense potential to simplify complex processes across various domains, including healthcare, education, and finance. The legal domain, however, still lags behind in terms of accessibility and user-centered technological innovation. Most existing legal resources are either too technical for the general public or too fragmented to provide meaningful assistance. Individuals who attempt to represent themselves in family courts frequently struggle with understanding essential legal concepts, preparing proper documentation, or even determining the correct procedural steps to follow. As a result, many legal issues remain unresolved or are handled inefficiently, leading to delayed justice and unnecessary distress.

To address these challenges, \textbf{Juriscope} is developed as an AI-powered legal assistance platform specifically designed to simplify family law processes. The system leverages the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) to make legal information more understandable and accessible. It provides users with plain-language explanations of complex legal terms, AI-driven document summarization for better comprehension of lengthy case files or legal documents, and step-by-step personalized guidance tailored to individual cases. By bridging the gap between legal professionals and the general public, Juriscope aims to empower individuals to make informed legal decisions and handle essential legal procedures with confidence and clarity.

In essence, Juriscope acts as a digital companion for users dealing with family law matters, offering transparency, simplicity, and reliability within the legal system. The platform not only enhances accessibility but also promotes awareness of legal rights and responsibilities, ensuring that justice is no longer a privilege reserved for those who can afford professional legal assistance. Through the integration of AI technologies, Juriscope envisions a future where every citizen, regardless of their financial or educational background, can access the knowledge and tools needed to navigate the legal landscape effectively.

\section{Motivation}

India, with its vast and diverse population, continues to face significant challenges in ensuring that legal knowledge and services are accessible to all citizens. Legal literacy remains alarmingly low, especially among individuals residing in rural and semi-urban areas where awareness about legal rights and procedures is minimal. Many people, despite being entitled to justice under the law, are unable to seek or obtain it effectively due to their limited understanding of legal processes and the prohibitive costs associated with professional legal consultation. Family law matters—such as divorce, child custody, domestic disputes, or inheritance—often demand not only legal precision but also emotional sensitivity and procedural accuracy. Unfortunately, the lack of affordable legal assistance and the complexity of the judicial system make it extremely difficult for ordinary citizens to navigate these issues independently.

The motivation behind developing \textbf{Juriscope} arises from this pressing need to make legal systems more inclusive, understandable, and efficient through the use of advanced technology. With the advent of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, it has become possible to interpret, summarize, and present complex legal information in simple and accessible formats. Juriscope aims to leverage these technologies to serve as a bridge between technology and justice—translating dense legal jargon into plain, comprehensible language and offering step-by-step guidance for individuals handling their own family law cases. This not only empowers users to act with greater confidence but also reduces their dependence on costly legal intermediaries.

Moreover, Juriscope embodies the vision of promoting digital inclusivity in the justice system. By creating an AI-powered platform capable of summarizing case documents, interpreting legal provisions, and providing personalized procedural support, the project strives to ensure that legal help is not confined to those with financial or educational advantages. The motivation extends beyond technological innovation; it is rooted in a deep social responsibility to democratize access to justice and enhance public trust in the legal process. 

In essence, Juriscope seeks to transform how people interact with the legal system—turning complexity into clarity and confusion into empowerment. By harnessing AI for legal understanding, the platform aspires to reduce the knowledge gap between legal professionals and ordinary citizens, thereby fostering a society where justice is truly accessible, affordable, and equitable for all.


\section{Problem Statement \& Objectives}
\noindent
\textbf{\fontsize{16}{12}\selectfont 3. Problem Statement \& Objectives}\\[0.6cm]
\justifying
\noindent
\textbf{Problem Statement:}\\[0.2cm]
\noindent
In India, navigating the legal system remains a daunting task for the majority of citizens, particularly in areas related to family law such as divorce, child custody, property division, and adoption. Legal documents are often filled with highly technical terminology and intricate procedural requirements that make them inaccessible to non-experts. As a result, individuals without legal backgrounds struggle to interpret or act upon legal information accurately. Furthermore, the cost of professional legal consultation is often prohibitively high, making justice inaccessible to low-income individuals and families. 

While there are several online platforms that provide basic legal information, most of these systems are static and lack interactivity. They fail to address user-specific queries, do not adapt to individual case contexts, and provide little to no actionable assistance. Users are often left with general information that does not translate into clear next steps for their particular legal situations. Additionally, the absence of intelligent document summarization tools and contextual understanding further complicates the user’s experience. There is thus an urgent need for a dynamic, AI-powered platform that can interpret legal language, generate personalized responses, and guide users through legal procedures in a structured and comprehensible manner.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
\textbf{Objectives:}\\[0.2cm]
\noindent
The primary objective of the \textbf{Juriscope} platform is to harness artificial intelligence to simplify family law processes and make legal assistance accessible, understandable, and actionable for everyone. The following are the key objectives that guide the development of this system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Develop an AI-powered legal chatbot:}  
    Create an intelligent conversational agent capable of addressing user queries related to family law, such as divorce, custody disputes, and adoption procedures. The chatbot should provide context-aware responses in simple language, making legal communication easier for the general public.

    \item \textbf{Integrate legal document upload and automated summarization:}  
    Allow users to upload lengthy legal documents such as petitions, court orders, or affidavits, and automatically generate concise, plain-language summaries using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This helps users quickly grasp the essence of complex documents without relying on professionals.

    \item \textbf{Provide procedural guidance using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):}  
    Implement RAG-based AI models that can retrieve accurate legal information from a knowledge base and combine it with generative capabilities to deliver step-by-step guidance tailored to the user’s situation. This ensures reliability, relevance, and clarity in responses.

    \item \textbf{Leverage LoRA fine-tuned models for efficient reasoning:}  
    Employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on compact large language models such as \textbf{Gemma 3n} to enhance reasoning, contextual understanding, and response generation efficiency. This approach ensures reduced computational overhead while maintaining high-quality legal insights.

    \item \textbf{Design a secure and user-friendly MERN-stack web platform:}  
    Build an interactive web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that provides a seamless user experience, integrates AI functionalities, and ensures secure data storage and communication between users and the system.

    \item \textbf{Incorporate multilingual support for inclusivity:}  
    Enable the platform to interact with users in multiple Indian languages to overcome linguistic barriers and promote accessibility for citizens from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

    \item \textbf{Ensure data privacy and ethical compliance:}

\section*{Use Case Diagram}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{USECASE.drawio.png}
\caption{Use Case Diagram for Juriscope}
\end{figure}

The use case diagram of \textbf{Juriscope} illustrates the functional interactions between users (actors) and the system. It represents how the system supports both end-users (clients) and administrators (legal experts or system maintainers) in achieving their objectives. The left side of the diagram corresponds to user interactions, while the right side represents admin functionalities. The central ovals depict the various system processes or use cases, showing what each actor can perform.

\subsection*{1. User Actor}
The \textbf{User} is any individual seeking legal guidance or document simplification. Their first step is \textbf{Registration}, where they create an account and input basic personal details. After successful \textbf{Login}, the user gains access to the chatbot system. The user can then \textbf{Ask Initial Legal Questions} related to specific problems such as divorce, custody, or property disputes. This input is processed by the AI model using \textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} to understand the intent of the query.

\subsection*{2. Document Handling and Simplification}
Users can \textbf{Upload Legal Documents (PDF/DOCX)} such as petitions, court orders, or agreements. The system uses AI models (like \textbf{LoRA-fine-tuned Gemma 3n Transformers}) to interpret and extract key legal clauses. The \textbf{Chatbot Simplifies Document Language} use case allows the AI to translate complex legal terminology into plain, easy-to-understand language. This feature empowers users with low legal literacy to comprehend their legal documents confidently.

\subsection*{3. Legal Guidance and Support}
Once the query or document is processed, the \textbf{Chatbot Explains Steps} use case is triggered. Here, the system generates personalized, step-by-step legal guidance — for example, what forms to file, deadlines to meet, and possible next actions. The chatbot also draws from an \textbf{External Database}, which contains legal precedents, statutes, and case data to ensure the advice is contextually relevant and accurate.

\subsection*{4. Admin Actor}
The \textbf{Admin} or \textbf{Legal Expert} logs into the system through \textbf{Admin Login}. They can \textbf{Manage Legal Knowledge}, ensuring the database stays updated with current laws and verified content. They can also \textbf{View User Queries} to monitor common issues, improve the AI’s accuracy, and maintain transparency. The \textbf{Monitor Dashboard} feature allows admins to analyze chatbot performance, response times, and system usage, while \textbf{Monitor System Activity} ensures data integrity, user privacy, and compliance with legal data regulations.

\subsection*{5. External Database Interaction}
The \textbf{External Database} serves as the knowledge base for the chatbot. It stores information on Indian legal acts, user-uploaded documents, and AI-processed summaries. This interaction is vital for the system’s \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)} module, which helps fetch relevant legal content during chatbot responses.

\bigskip
In summary, the use case diagram for Juriscope demonstrates a user-friendly AI-driven legal assistant that bridges the gap between citizens and complex legal systems. It provides accessible, low-cost legal help by guiding users through initial legal steps, simplifying legal jargon, and offering context-aware advice. Administrators ensure reliability, data security, and continuous improvement of the system—making Juriscope a step forward in democratizing access to justice through artificial intelligence.
